## How to Use

#### Requirements

A full TeX distribution is assumed.
[systems (Windows, Mac, \*nix) are available](
http://tex.stackexchange.com/q/55437)
but TeX Live is recommended.
You can [install TeX from upstream](http://tex.stackexchange.com/q/1092)
(recommended; most up-to-date)
or use `sudo apt-get install texlive-full` if you really want that.
(It's generally a few years behind.)

#### Usage

At a command prompt, run

```bash
$ make
```
